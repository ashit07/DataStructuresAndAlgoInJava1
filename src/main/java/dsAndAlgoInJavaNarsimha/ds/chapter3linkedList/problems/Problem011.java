 * There are two possibilities for L, it either ends (snake) or its last element
 * pts back to one of the earlier elements in the list (snail). Task is to 
 * device an algo that tests whether a given list L is a snake or snail. 
 * (Same as problem -7) 
 * 
 * Solution: Use Floyd Cycle Finding Algo (Same as Problem-10)
