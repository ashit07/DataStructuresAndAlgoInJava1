/**
 * Problem-22: Is there any other way of solving Problem-18?
 * Solution: Using "finding the first repeating number" approach in an array(In searching chapter).
 * Algo: 
 * a) Create an array A and keep all the next ptrs of both the lists in the array.
 * b) In the array, find the first repeating element in the array
 * c) The first repeating number indicates the merging pt of both the lists.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(m+n)
 * Space Complexity: O(m+n)
