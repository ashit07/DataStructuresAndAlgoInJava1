/**
 * Problem-37: If we want to concatenate two linked lists which of the
 * following gives O(1) complexity?
 * a) Singly Linked Lists b) Doubly Linked Lists c) Circular doubly linked lists
 * 
 * Solution: Circular Doubly Linked lists. This is because for singly and 
 * doubly linked lists, we need to traverse the list till end and append the
 * second list. But in case of circular doubly linked lists we dont have to 
 * traverse the list.
