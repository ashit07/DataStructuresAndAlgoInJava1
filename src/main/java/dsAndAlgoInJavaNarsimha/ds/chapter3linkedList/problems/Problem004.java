/**
 * Problem-4:   Can we use Problem-3 approach for solving Problem-2 without creating hash table.
 * Solution:	Yes, using HashTable.
 * Find the length of node by traversing the list from head node. 
 * Then compute M-n+1th from the beginning.
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(n)+O(n) = O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
