/**
 * Problem: Can we further improve the complexity of Problem-56?
 * Solution: Yes, by using inorder traversal. The idea behind this soln is that,
 * 	inorder traversal of BST produces sorted lists. While traversing the BST in
 * 	inorder, at each node check the condition that its key value shld be greater 
 * 	than the key value of its prev visited node. Also, we need to 
 * 	initialize the prev with possible min integer value.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: 
 * Space Complexity:
